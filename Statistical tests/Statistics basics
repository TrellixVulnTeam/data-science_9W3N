null hypothsis: when comparing 2 things: there's no difference. H0: old drug and the new drug has no difference. 
                when trying figure out 1 variable, then it. H0: there's normal distribution

P-value = difference is due to random chance within the probability 0 to 1. => if p< Alpha => significant

shapiro wilkins test(for small dataset): test of normality: 

other tests of normality: 
 a ) Skew is a quantification of how much a distribution is pushed left or right, a measure of asymmetry in the distribution.
 b) Kurtosis quantifies how much of the distribution is in the tail. It is a simple and commonly used statistical test for normality
 c) The D’Agostino’s K2 test => does both Skewness and Kurtosis
 d)  Anderson-Darling Test 


How can you assume your data is normally distributed enough to do a t-test?

 - a good rule of thumb is that anything with kurtosis from -2.5 to 2.5 and skewness from -1.5 to 1.5 is close enough for a t-test to work well.
