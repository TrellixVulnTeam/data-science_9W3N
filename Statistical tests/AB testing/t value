T test 

𝑡=(𝑦1−𝑦2)/ √ (𝑠1^2/𝑁1+𝑠2^2/𝑁2) = mean difference divided by the statistical noise

𝑦1 and 𝑦2 - represent the sample means of groups 1 and 2.
𝑠1 and 𝑠2 -represent the sample standard deviations of groups 1 and 2.
𝑁1 and 𝑁2 represent the sample sizes for groups 1 and groups 2


Larger t-values mean that the difference between the groups is less likely to be due to noise.


Notice how, as variance gets larger (staying in the same column and comparing down rows) it gets harder and harder to tell the means apart. Comparing within a row, however, it is clear that regardless of variance, larger sample sizes make it easier to tell the means apart.


With a t-test we calculate the t-statistic, which gives us the size of the group difference divided by the noise level of the data. Bigger t-values signal a group difference large enough to be interesting to us.
