Problem 1: 

The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used. 

Answer: 
 - The sample size 50 is too small. 
 - It is not clear whether 50 droids were chosen in randomized fashion.  
 - The captured droids probably wouldn't believe in joining rhw Sith Lord to rule the galaxy. They probably are angry and some of them might have lied to escape the prisoner situation. 



Problem 2: When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily. 

Answer: 
 - The opt in group are probably reflects group who are more active.
 - The name of the app is probably more appealing to certain personality types
 -
