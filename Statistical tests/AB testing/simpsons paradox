Between 2000 and 2013, the median wage for the entire population in the US has slightly risen although the median wage for each educational group has fallen. This is called Simpsons paradox or lurking variable. Another example would be the lower overall admission rate for females than males in graduate schools. However in overall, female applicant were more likely to be accepted if you break down the applicants by gender.

When doing A/B testing, hopefully all your participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to see version A or version B, and both your groups will be equal in size. By using randomization to equalize lurking variables like demographics, we can avoid Simpson's Paradox. Because randomization is random, however, there is always the chance that your groups will end up with some lurking difference.
