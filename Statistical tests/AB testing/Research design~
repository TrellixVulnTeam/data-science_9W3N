Problem: 
How to decrease employee churn? Churn creates inefficiency as new people have to be trained in and knowledge from experienced workers is lost. In exit interviews, employees name "out-of-date technology" and "poor communication" as major motivations to leave.

Potential solution: Adding Slack to employee computers will decrease churn by increasing communication.

The method to test the solution: A/B test.
