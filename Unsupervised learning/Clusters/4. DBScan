1. Hyperparameters: 
 a) a radius epsilon =  𝜖 defines the radius within which to search for nearby neighbors.
 b) a neighborhood density 𝛳. 
 c) minPts is the minimum number of points required to form a cluster.


2. Types of data:
  a) Core point: A point that has at least a minimum number of other points (minPts) within its radius.
  b) Border point: A point that is within the radius
  c) Noise point: A point that is neither a core point nor a border point.
 
3. How it works?
  - assign the core point randomly and from then on try to iteratively find the core point within given parameteres.
