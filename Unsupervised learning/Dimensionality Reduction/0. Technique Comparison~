1. PCA = has been around since 1933
       = very linear => has hard with non-linear data like image processing, NLP

2. T-sne = since 2008
         = good at capturing the non-linear structure in high dimensional data

3. UMAP = since 2018
        = very similar to T-sne on visualization ut much faster
        = more general use in ML
