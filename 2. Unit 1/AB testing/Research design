Problem: 
How to decrease employee churn? Churn creates inefficiency as new people have to be trained in and knowledge from experienced workers is lost. In exit interviews, employees name "out-of-date technology" and "poor communication" as major motivations to leave.

Potential solution: Adding Slack to employee computers will decrease churn by increasing communication.

The method to test the solution: A/B test. 

    Install Slack on half of the employees' computers and monitor churn for the next two months. The variable of interest is churn in Slack and non-Slack groups. This is an A/B manipulation where Slack is installed or not installed.

    We will compute the churn rate for two months before the study and compare it to the churn rate in Slack and non-Slack groups for two months during the study.

    If churn in the next two months decreases by 10% among Slack users (using churn estimates from the past year), conclude that Slack is effective and install on all computers. If churn in the next two months decreases among Slack users, but by less than one standard deviation, observe for two more months before deciding. If churn does not decrease in two months, uninstall Slack.
