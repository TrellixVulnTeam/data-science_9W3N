Actual| No  | 950  | 10                 Actual  | No  | TN | FP
      | S   | 15   | 25                         | S   | FN | TP                   TN= True Negative, FN = False Negative, TP= True Positive



Accuracy = 970/1000 => biased toward data that has HIGH TN

Recall = 25/ (15 + 25 )= 62.5% = TP/(TP + FN) => row wise => when FN importance is high => misclassified contgiously Sick person as healthy@

Precision = 25/ (25 + 10) = 71%= TP/(TP +FP ) => column wise => when FP importance is high => misclassified 'College Acceptance Letter' as a Spam!
