Univariate Analysis: 
a) Continuous: 1. Histograms (distribution of the dataset )
               2. QQ plots (close a variable is to known distribution, and any outliers. )

b) Categorical:1. Barchart
               2. Wordcloud: from wordcloud import WordCloud => occurance is represented by the size
               3. Pie Chart

Bivariate analysis: 
a) Continuous - Categorical     : Boxplot (compare groups and to identify differences in variance, as well as outliers.)
                                  Line plots, barplot
b) Continuous - Continuous      : Scatterplots, Heatmap, Line plots
c) Categorical - Categorical    : Countplot
